### Disclaimers
I'm guessing you already installed java, downloaded prism launcher from https://prismlauncher.org/download/ and that you already logged on your Microsoft (Minecraft) account.

# Guide start

When you fist open the app it should ask you to set up java, which you should already have installed, log into your Microsoft (Minecraft) account and your language.
Then you should be greeted by the main screen which would look similar to this
