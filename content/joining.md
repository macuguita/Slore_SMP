title: How to join

# This is an application only server!

This means you have to make an application to join first, you can make an application in the [applications](https://discord.com/channels/1221495511354179664/1221498375124553900) channel!
We would recommend you put actual effort in the application, do not answer thing with only one sentence!!
Once you finished your application a staff member will tell you whatever you forgot to fill out, you will know you've been accepted because you will receive a message from the tickets bot that says:
>Thank you for applying to Slore SMP! You meet our qualifications for this server and have been whitelisted! Before you proceed, make sure you have read our rules. We hope you have fun on our server and do not be afraid to ask questions!

If you have questions about installing the modpack or joining the server follow our [[guidebook]]!
