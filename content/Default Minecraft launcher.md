### Disclaimers
I'm guessing you already installed java, downloaded the official Minecraft launcher from https://www.minecraft.net/download, that you already logged on your Microsoft (Minecraft) account and that you played Minecraft 1.20.1 at least once.

# Guide start

First what you have to do is install the installed for the mod loader, we are using Fabric, so make sure to download the installer from https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/, make sure to download the **Client** one.
Once you downloaded and opened the file you should be greeted by a screen that looks like this, make sure to select the options I selected below

After Fabric finishes downloading make sure it is installed by opening your Minecraft launcher and looking through your instances, you should see that Fabric is installed like it shows on the picture below

After that head to the "Installations" tag at the top of your screen and click **edit** under your Fabric installation

You will then be prompted with this screen, please click more options

You mush change "**-Xmx2G**" to "**-Xmx4G**", You are simply changing the 2 to a 4. Once you've done that, click **save**

Once that is completed, head over to ‚Å†the [modpack](https://discord.com/channels/1221495511354179664/1221499038180970567) Discord channel and download files from the **Google Drive link**!!!!!!. Then, proceed to open up the Fabric installation's mod folder. Drag the **unzipped**!!!!!!. mods into that folder.

Once you've completed all of those steps, the mods should be installed and you can boot up minecraft through the launcher. By clicking the **green** "**Play**" button, It takes around 1 minute to load, probably less if you have a good computer.

The server's IP address is:
```slore-smp.minecraft.casa```

Once you did all of that click the "Done" button and make sure to select the server and click "Join Server"!
